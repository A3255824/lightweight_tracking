function combinedStructure = analyze_on_off_dopamine_iteration_three(data,video,sagittal_length,conf_threshold)
%% This is a master function that prepares the data for analysis, identifies, peaks and troughs, and outputs 
% quantified gait metrics based on selected epochs. 
%% Step #1: Data Structuring
% This step involves preprocessing the input data and associated video. It extracts the video's frame rate,
% matches timestamps between the video file name and data entries, filters data rows based on these timestamps,
% and calculates the time in minutes and seconds for each frame in the filtered data set.
[filteredData, videoTime, videoObj] = data_structuring_iteration_two(data, video);
%% Step #2: Gait Metric Analysis (Plotting Function)
% This step involves visualizing the gait cycle by plotting the ankle's movements in both x and y coordinates over time. 
% It uses a specified confidence threshold to filter and interpolate the ankle data before plotting, 
% helping to analyze the symmetry and patterns in the gait cycle for both left and right ankles.
plot_ankle_cycles_iteration_two(filteredData, videoTime, videoObj,conf_threshold);
%% Step #3: Identify epoch selections based on body movement
% Function processes filtered data, identify peaks and troughs in the overall mean
% X coordinate, and segment the data into epochs. Each epoch is defined as a sequence
% from peak to peak with a trough in the middle. The output 'epochData' is a 
% structure array containing the segmented data for left and right X, Y 
% coordinates of the ankle for each identified epoch.
[epochData,epochDataPruned] = identify_peaks_troughs_iteration_three(filteredData,videoTime,videoObj,conf_threshold);
%% Step #4: Compute x-coordinate gait metrics
% This is a master function with a suite of functions performs comprehensive gait analysis by first 
% analyzing stride characteristics, including stride length and asymmetry between the left and right foot, 
% by identifying crossover points and calculating distances and times. It then extends the analysis to pair 
% consecutive gait epochs into complete cycles, evaluating cycle times, visualizing gait patterns, and 
% computing statistical measures like average and standard deviation for both cycle times and asymmetries. 
% This holistic approach aids in a detailed understanding of gait dynamics, stride mechanics, and symmetry, 
% crucial for biomechanical assessments and rehabilitation planning.
